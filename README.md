# Labios

LABIOS, a new, distributed, scalable, and adaptive I/O System.
LABIOS is the first LAbel-Based I/O System, is fully decoupled,
and is intended to grow in the intersection of HPC and BigData.

## Installation

We use spack for installing labios

```bash
spack install labios
```

## Deployment

```bash
jarvis labios scaffold default
jarvis labios init
jarvis labios start
jarvis labios stop
```

# TODO LIST

## Future

*   Task dependecies (don't care)
*   Metadata persistent store (flush at the end)
*   Automated server bootstrapping
*   Investigate read simulation
*   Handle MDM for outstanding operations (data in transit)
    *   Discuss how important is this issue of decoupled components
    *   Possible fixes:
        *   Invalidation lists + timer expiration to cleanup
        *   Intermediate state of data in MDM

## Notes

*   Timeout task scheduling. line#66
*   check the usleep in task scheduler-> infinite looping
*   Aggregating logs
    `cat ts_* >> ts.csv`
*   Printing correctly
    `std::stringstream stream; // #include <sstream> for this
    stream << 1 << 2 << 3;
    std::cout << stream.str();`
